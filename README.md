# **To-do List** (Written in PHP)

### Overview
In order to refresh my knowledge of PHP, I have decided to design, implement and test a web-based to-do list app.

### Project Brief / Requirements 
**Definition**
The Oxford English Dictionary (online) defines a [to-do list](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/to-do-list?q=to-do+list) as:

> A list of tasks that need to be completed, typically organized in order of priority.

**Minimum Requirements / Features**
- Each to-do list item consists of:
	- Title
	- Description (max. 100 characters)
	- Complete/incomplete?
	- Date/time created
	- Date/time last updated
- Initially, users must log in using their username and password (new users are required to register first)
- Users must be able to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) items in their to-do list
- To-do list items can be marked as completed

**Additional Requirements / Features**
- To-do list items can be reordered 
- To-do list items can be categorised into folders
- Provide users with relevant stats, such as:
	- Total number of items in to-do list (complete and incomplete)
	- Total number of  items completed in the last year/month/week/day
	- Percentage increase/decrease of items completed in the last year/month/week/day
- Users can collaborate with others and share to-do lists
